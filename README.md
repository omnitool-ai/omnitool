## Why Omnitool?

With thousands of preprints and countless "AI tools" released each week, it is incredibly challenging to stay on top of the rapidly evolving AI ecosystem, to separate hype and facts and to extract durable long term skills and learning. PapersWithCode and GitHub repositories attached to arXiv papers provide ability to hands-on validate and apply the latest discoveries, but the fragile nature of the Python ecosystem and often steep hardware requirments dramatically limits accessibility. Likewise implementing and testing cloud based models requires delving deep into API documentation and wrestling with connecting code.

We believe that is a serious problem. AI may represent the first large scale technological disruption unbounded by logistical challenges, scaling along existing wires, API infastructure and app delivery platforms. Meanwhile, market pressure to adopt AI is felt by many businesses and teams.

Without educated decision makers and technical experts,  businesses and public organisations alike are at high risk of falling for hype and magical narratives and expensive misadventures.      

Omnitool is our attempt to improve this situation: A **single, unified interface** capable of connecting with as many AI models as possible and to **reduce the "time to hands on AI" to an absolute minimum**. 

Omnitool is **highly extensible and interoperable**. Most OpenAPI3 based services can be connected and turned into "blocks" without writing code. It's extension framework enables deeper integrations of anything from custom UIs (Like Stability Dream Studio) to Game Engines (like BabyonJS or Phaser) to [Image manipulation libraries](https://github.com/georgzoeller/omni-extension-sharp/blob/master/README.md).


## What Omnitool is NOT

- Omnitool is **not a multi-user cloud SaaS product**. It's a downloadable, locally installed product. 
- Omnitool is **NOT a no-code solution** meant to replace coding or enable non engineers to code. It's focused on interacting with AI use cases, not writing general purpose software.
- Omnitool is **not production/enterprise software**. (Yet.) It's a lab optimizing for access to the latest technologies over stability and, as with any lab, things may blow up from time to time.

Omnitool is able to generate blocks from any openapi.json definitions via URL or directly supplied file. We support a number of custom x- annotations that can be added to openapi definitions to allow omnitool to guide the block generation. It also supports creating "patches" on top of existing APIs to create customized blocks. With integrated JSONATA support, it is possible to build powerful data processing blocks using pure data.


### Extensible Architecture

* Inspired by the common modding architecture found in video game toolsets, Omnitool is built, from the ground up, to be extensible via multiple mechanisms:  
  * Simple **Client and Server scripts** allowing addition of /commands that are hot-reloaded, so editing and building is a breeze.
  * **Client Extensions** - any web-app/webpage can be turned into an extension and integrated directly on Omnitool's desktop via it's window system. Omnitool's client SDK exposes the full range of platform functionality to extensions, allowing you to write apps or tools using every API or recipe enabled in Omnitool. 
  * **Server Extensions** - Server extensions written in javascript that can add new blocks, API and core functionality.

* Some examples of currently available extensions:
  * omni-core-replicate, a core extensions that allows import of any AI model on [replicate.com](https://replicate.com) into a ready to use block in Omnitool 
  * [omni-extension-sharp](https://github.com/omnitool-community/omni-extension-sharp), an extension adding an array of Image Manipulation blocks such as format conversion, masking, composition and more based on the powerful [sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp) image processing library.
  * omni-extension-minipaint, a powerful [photo editing tool](https://github.com/viliusle/miniPaint) useful for quickly creating and editing images without switching out of the app.
  * omni-extension-openpose, a [OpenPose based](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) pose estimation and generation toolkit useful for creating guidance images for controlnet/diffusion models.
  * omni-extension-tldraw, a whiteboarding/sketching extension built on [TLDraw](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw), useful for generating input for visual transformers and diffusion models
  * omni-extension-wavacity, a [full wasm implementation](https://wavacity.com/) of Audacity, a state of the art audio recorder/editor useful for generating and editing audio content.
    
* Visit the Extension tab in app or see our [Omnitool Community Github](https://github.com/orgs/omnitool-community/repositories) for a list of currently available extensions

## 📖 Documentation
[Omnitool Docs](https://omnitool-ai.gitbook.io/omnitool)
  
## Quickstart Guide

We are currently testing installers for Windows and macOS. Until those are publicly available, please follow the manual installation steps.

## Manual Install

This guide will help you download the Omnitool software, and then build and start the Omnitool server in a directory running from your local machine.

You can then access the Omnitool software from a web browser on your local machine.

1. **Prerequisites**

  Ensure you have the following sofware installed:

 * [Latest Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)
 * [Latest LTS Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
 * [Classic Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)


2. **Get the Source Code**
 - Open a terminal
 - Navigate to where you want Omnitool to be installed 
 - Use the following command:
  ```
    git clone https://github.com/omnitool-ai/omnitool
  ```

  This will create the `omnitool` folder.  

  - Now navigate inside Omnitool's folder. By default:
  ```
    cd omnitool
  ```

3. **Install Source Dependencies**

  Run the following command in the root of the repository to install the necessary dependencies:
  ```
    yarn install
  ```
**Troubleshooting**

* **PYTHON 3.12** - some users are reporting a yarn install failure due to **a missing python module 'distutils'**. To resolve this, we recommend running our fix script to detect and autofix any potential issues and try again. Or you can manually pip install 'setuptools' from the terminal.
```
  node setup\fix.js
```

4. **Build and Start the Server**

  Now we will use `yarn` and `Node.js` to build the server software locally on your machine and then start it running.

  Windows:
  ```
    start.bat
  ```

  MacOS/Linux:
  ```
   ./start.sh
  ```

  When successful, you will see the following message:

  ```
◐ Booting Server
✔ Server has started and is ready to accept connections on http://127.0.0.1:1688.
✔ Ctrl-C to quit.
```

5. **Open Omnitool in a Web Browser**

  Omnitool.ai can now be accessed from:
  [127.0.0.1:1688](http://127.0.0.1:1688)  

---
6. **Explore the Sample Recipes**
  Use the "Load Recipe" button in the menu to explore different functionality of the platform.

---
7. **Explore the Code**
  For a list of scripts we use internally, try running:
  ```
    yarn run
  ```

## Generating a JWT Token

Our service allows you to generate a JWT by running a specific script designed for this purpose. The script's signature is as follows:

```
/generateJwtToken <action> <subject> <expires_in>
```

**Parameters**

- `<action>`: This is a string parameter identifying the intended action to be performed. In the context of running recipes, this should be set to exec.
- `<subject>`: This is a string parameter that specifies the subject of the JWT. This could be the recipe that you intend to execute.
- `<expires_in>`: This is an integer parameter that determines the token's validity period in milliseconds.

**Example**

To generate a JWT for executing a recipe with a validity of 30,000 milliseconds (or 30 seconds), you would run the following script:

```
/generateJwtToken exec Workflow 30000
```

Please see [examples/api.mjs] for an example javascript which runs a recipe.


**Output**

The script will output a JWT, which is a token string to be used in the authorization header for your API requests.

### Executing a recipe with JWT Authentication

Once you have your JWT, you can execute a recipe by making a POST request to the recipe execution API. This request must include the JWT in the Authorization header.

**Endpoint**

```
POST http://127.0.0.1:1688/api/v1/workflow/exec
```

**Header**

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

`<token>` is the JWT acquired from the /generateJwtToken script.

**Curl Example**

To make the request using curl, you would use the following command, replacing <token> with your actual JWT:

```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:1688/api/v1/workflow/exec -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

**Response**

Upon success, the API will initiate the specified recipe. You will receive a JSON response containing details about the recipe's execution status, including any outputs or errors.

**Security Considerations**

- Keep your JWT secure to prevent unauthorized access to your recipes.
- Always use a secure connection to interact with the APIs.
- Regularly rotate your tokens and use a short expiration time to minimize the impact of potential leaks.

** Getting Results **

Once a job is finished, you can use the /api/v1/workflow/results?jobId=<jobId> to retrieve the results.


**Troubleshooting**

* If you encounter authorization errors, ensure the JWT has not expired, is correctly set in the header, and was generated with the proper parameters.
